        //          this is our MainViewController, or self)
        //     2. action: the method we want to be called when the button (or other
        //          UI element) is interacted with
        //     3. for: (controlEvents) here we tell Xcode when we want the action 
        //          to be called. In this case, I put ".touchDown" since I want 
        //          "goToNextView" to be called every time the user touches down on the button
